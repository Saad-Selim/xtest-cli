## [0.3.1] - 2025-01-06

### Changed
- CLI now opens a local browser AND mirrors actions to a server browser
- Dashboard shows the server browser that mirrors your local actions
- Best of both worlds: local control with dashboard visibility

### How it works
1. CLI opens a browser on your laptop
2. CLI creates a mirror browser on the server
3. Every action in your local browser is mirrored to the server browser
4. Dashboard shows the server browser in real-time

- Reverted breaking change from 0.3.0
- Local browser control is restored
- Dashboard visibility is maintained through mirroring

### Fixed

- Browser actions are properly synchronized with the server
