## Development Guidelines

### Code Style

We use TypeScript with the following conventions:
- 2 spaces for indentation
- Single quotes for strings
- Semicolons required
- Trailing commas in multi-line objects/arrays

Run linting:
```bash
npm run lint
```

### Testing

- Write unit tests for services
- Add integration tests for commands
- Test error scenarios
- Mock external dependencies

Run tests:
```bash
npm test
npm run test:watch  # During development
```
